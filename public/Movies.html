<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Twilight</h3>

<p>Honestly I LOVE twilight❤️Movies and books are both so cool💞. I think it’s such a beautiful story between Bella Edward and Jacob. I love the love triangle and all the movies but I have to say my favourite is either the first twilight or eclipse💞. Most people are on team</p>

<h3>The Mummy</h3>

<p>Five out of Five. 5/5 The Mummy" is a delightful treasure of a movie that has everything that any film fanatic could ever desire; a fascinating and exciting adventure film in ancient Egypt, and a dynamic genre hybrid at that; it is a raucous horror movie, a rousing adventure, an intriguing fantasy film, a witty comedy, and a good-natured romantic story all wrapped up into one. Throughout it's breezy two-hour running time,</p>

<h3>Titanic</h3>

<p>I find this movie one of my childhood favourites I was only 7 to 8 yrs old when it came out used to watch it loads on video back when modern technology Youtube did not exist. On 100th anniversary mum and I watched it in 3d and recently watched it again together for 25th year since it was released it even went on my own to see it again as its just so epic I just feel like I could watch it over 100 times.</p>
